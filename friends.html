        <br class="visible-xs"><p class="blurb">  Hankerton, known as Hank by his friends, has a great love of adventure and hopes to travel to all 7 continents one day. So far his travels have taken him to Grand Cayman where he could swim with the manta rays and to Mexico, and to the jungles of Belize. In the next couple years - Europe is in his sights, and he hopes to take Kiwi to Paris with him. <br> Besides his travels, Hank is a homeowner and shares his home with a few roommates, and friends. He is the handy man around the house and he even repaired the furnace multiple a couple times when it broke and even put in a firepit outside. He considers himself a jack of all trades-  Or a Hank of all trades as it should go! </p>

Pepper plants are her favorite summer items to grow. She also grows all kinds of lettuce, and herbs.
